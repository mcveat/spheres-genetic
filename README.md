# Sphere Genetics

Simple Unity3d game as a proof of concept of *genetic-based-flat-world-crawler*, if you will ;).

## How it works

Game is populated with random spheres. They can differ in size, speed, color, and shininess of material. Player,
starting as white sphere, roams the plane and mate with other spheres. In result two new siblings are created. Each
sibling has a features recalculated, randomly biased towards one of the parents. There is a small chance of minor
mutation, which moves new features a little further away from parents. There is a slight chance of totally random
mutation to.

## How to play

Arrows to move. Space to mate. You have to be close enough to the other sphere for it to happen. Other spheres will stop
when you approach. After mating, other sphere is not going to mate for some time (it is tired, you know).
